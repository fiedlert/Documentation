to see details when booting there are two solutions

Option 1. To see the traditional graphical boot

edit /etc/init.d/functions

search for rhgb-client

you should find a block something similar to this ( its different between RHEL4/5 )

# Inform the graphical boot of our current state
update_boot_stage() {
  if [ "$GRAPHICAL" = "yes" -a -x /usr/bin/rhgb-client ]; then
    /usr/bin/rhgb-client --update="$1"
  fi    
  return 0
} 

change this line

/usr/bin/rhgb-client --update="$1"

to this

/usr/bin/rhgb-client --update="$1" --details=yes


option 2. To get a non graphical boot screen

edit /boot/grub/grub.conf

find the kernel you are booting to the block should look similar to

title Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS (2.6.9-42.ELsmp)
        root (hd0,0)
        kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.9-42.ELsmp ro root=/dev/rootvg/rootlv rhgb quiet
        initrd /initrd-2.6.9-42.ELsmp.img

change this line 

kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.9-42.ELsmp ro root=/dev/rootvg/rootlv rhgb quiet

to this

kernel /vmlinuz-2.6.9-42.ELsmp ro root=/dev/rootvg/rootlv quiet
